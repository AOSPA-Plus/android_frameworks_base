      "message": "Wouldn\u0027t it be safer to check whether the handler has a GESTURE_REQUEST message before we send a new one? Especially since we delay it with 200ms, we can get another key event in this timeframe and that just means we\u0027re going to handle a new gesture without having finished handling the current one. I would suggest adding the check to the above scanCode check so we cancel (remove from queue) the current request and create a new one.\n\nAlso, why do we need a fixed delay of 200ms?",
